              Raheem Shaquille Sterling MBE (born 8 December 1994) is an English professional footballer who plays as a winger and attacking midfielder for Premier League club Manchester City and the England national team.
              Born in Jamaica to Jamaican parents, Sterling moved to London at the age of five. He began his career at Queens Park Rangers before signing for Liverpool in 2010. He was awarded the Golden Boy award in 2014. In July 2015, following a lengthy dispute over a new contract, he was signed by Manchester City in a transfer potentially worth £49 million, the highest transfer fee ever paid for an English player at the time. He went on to help Manchester City win back-to-back Premier League titles in the 2017–18 and 2018–19 seasons. In the 2018–19 season, he was named to the PFA Premier League Team of the Year and won the PFA Young Player of the Year and FWA Footballer of the Year.
              Sterling made his senior debut for England in November 2012 after previously being capped by England youth teams at under-16, under-17, under-19 and under-21 levels. He was chosen in England's squads for the FIFA World Cup in 2014 and 2018, and the UEFA European Championship in 2016 and 2020.
              On 7 August 2020, he scored the opening goal in a 2–1 home victory against Real Madrid, knocking them out of the Champions League in the Round of 16. It was his 100th goal for City in all competitions, becoming the first Englishman to reach this figure for the club since Dennis Tueart in 1981.
              On 15 August 2020, Manchester City lost 3–1 against Lyon in the Champions League quarter-finals, in which Sterling missed an open goal chance to level the score, as it was 2–1 for Lyon.
              On 7 February 2021, Sterling scored a goal in a 4–1 away win over his former team Liverpool, to reach his 100th goal with Manchester City under Pep Guardiola in all competitions. On 29 May 2021, he played in the 2021 UEFA Champions League Final, where Manchester City lost 1–0 against Chelsea.
